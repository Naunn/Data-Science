# DBSCAN CLUSTERING ====================================================================================================
# Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed by Martin
# Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, JÃ¶rg Sander and Xiaowei Xu in 1996. It is a density-based clustering non-parametric
# algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points 
# with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors
# are too far away). DBSCAN is one of the most common clustering algorithms and also most cited in scientific literature.

# Assumptions: DBSCAN works on the assumption that clusters are dense regions in space separated by regions of lower density

# Density-Based Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBScan) is an Unsupervised learning Non-linear algorithm. It does 
# use the idea of density reachability and density connectivity. The data is partitioned into groups with similar 
# characteristics or clusters but it does not require specifying the number of those groups in advance. A cluster is 
# defined as a maximum set of densely connected points. It discovers clusters of arbitrary shapes in spatial databases with noise.
