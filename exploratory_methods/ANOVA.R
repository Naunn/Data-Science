# ANOVA ================================================================================================================
# Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures 
# (such as the "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among means. ANOVA was developed
# by the statistician Ronald Fisher. ANOVA is based on the law of total variance, where the observed variance in a 
# particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest 
# form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes 
# the t-test beyond two means. In other words, the ANOVA is used to test the difference between two or more means.
# ANOVA attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements, also
# it uses categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable,
